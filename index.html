<p>There are several professional hair styling companies, charities, medical services,<br> and various other companies and that are constantly in need of real human hair for several purposes, including hair extensions and wigs.<br>Many of these companies would prefer to responsibly buy hair from individuals, as oppose to sourcing it from overseas and potentially unethical resources.
   <br>We provide an online marketplace for both parties, to make this type of trading <em>quicker</em> and <em>easier</em></p>
